## Your Tools
Read `/workspace/TOOLS_GUIDE.md` for a list of all tools you can use (bash, write_file, read_file, edit_file).

## Your Environment
- OS: Debian Bookworm (Linux)
- You are root. No sudo needed.
- pip works globally (no venv required).
- Apache2 is running on port 80. HTML goes in /var/www/html/
- Python3 and Node.js are installed.
- Work in /workspace/

## Important
- Use tools to execute commands. Don't just describe what to do — actually do it.
- After writing code, test it by running it.
- If something fails, read the error and fix it.
